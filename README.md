## Game Rules

### Snap
- A two-player game.
- Players take turns revealing cards.
- If two cards of the same rank are revealed consecutively, the player who notices first can call "Snap!" to win.
- The game continues until all cards are dealt.
- Players can choose to play again, choose a different game, or exit.

### Higher Lower
- A single-player game.
- The player must guess if the next card will be **Higher (H)** or **Lower (L)** than the previous card.
- If the guess is correct, the player scores a point. If incorrect, the game ends.
- The player can choose to play again, choose a different game, or exit.
